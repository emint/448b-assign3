      <p>This project attempts to visualize how great people traveled between ancient Greek cities.
        Nodes represent Greek cities and edges exist if two cities have had mroe than one common 
        person visit them.

      <p>To begin, please hover over a node. This will show you its connection as well as view of
        the world from its perspective. To exclude categories of people, please uncheck the category
        of person.

      <p>The radius of a node on the main graph is logarithmically proportional to number of 
        important people that have visited that city. Edge widths are proportional to number of 
        people shared between two cities. 

      <p>On the circle-packing graph, the size is proportional to the number of people shared with
        the selected city.
