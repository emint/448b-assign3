      <p>The radius of a node on the main graph is logarithmically proportional to number of 
        important people that have visited that city. Edge widths are proportional to number of 
        people shared between two cities. 

      <p>On the circle-packing graph, the size is proportional to the number of people shared with
        the selected city.
